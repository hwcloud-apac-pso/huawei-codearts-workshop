# Building your first CI/CD pipeline on Huawei CodeArts Service

### Introduction

In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the world of CodeArts service on Huawei Cloud, leverage the features provided in the CodeArts service to build different Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipeline to demonstrate different scenarios as below:
* Automated Continuous Integration pipeline triggered via code commit
* Blue-green deployment strategy for the production environment
* Version control rollback with the use of image tagging for the production environment
Throughout this lab manual, we will take you on a journey of configuring the basic elements that are required to build up a complete pipeline in order to achieve the continuous integration and continuous deployment of the web application to different environments. We will guide you step-by-step in configuring the build task, and deployment task and finally combine all the tasks together to make up a CI or CD pipeline. 
By the end of this lab, you will have a strong foundation in CI/CD pipeline configured using Huawei CodeArts services and youâ€™ll be able to apply these skills to empower and streamline your application development and deployment lifecycle.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of the lab, we are able to achieve as below:
* Configure the CI and CD pipeline using the CodeArts services such as Repo, Check, Build, Deploy, pipeline and etc.
* Configure the CD pipeline to achieve a blue-green deployment strategy in the production environment
* Configure image version tagging to achieve the version control rollback for the production environment

### Target Audience
This lab has been designed specifically for the engineers and operators who work under Huawei Cloud CodeArts service. Anyone interested in Huawei CodeArts service is welcome.

### Duration
On average, completing all the exercises in this lab will take around 2 hours and 15 minutes.

### Pre-requisites
Before going through the exercise in this lab, you should have some familiarity on below:
* Basic understanding of Huawei Cloud resources such as Cloud Container Engine (CCE) and Huawei CodeArts Service
* Basic understanding of the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) concept
